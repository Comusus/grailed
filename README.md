There were two main ways I thoguht that could be used to resolve collisions based
on the specifications of the assignment. One way would just to append 1 to the end
of a username until there would be no collision. Looking at the sample database, the
most collisions would be at 6 but even at 6, a username of 'x111111' would be weird
and this could lead to eventual memory problems if there were more collisions.

The other method would be to 


My overall rationality was that this solution was a temporary solution
to fix all of the , so it would be ran uncommonly and likely not too many times.
Therefore, I thought that using more Space complexity would be justified if
it will help.
